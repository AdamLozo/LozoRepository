# Jupyter Notebooks

Place your Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) here for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.

## Getting Started

1. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Create a new notebook and start exploring your data!

## Best Practices

- **Name notebooks clearly** - Use descriptive names with dates (e.g., `2026-01-13-sales-analysis.ipynb`)
- **Add markdown cells** - Document your thought process
- **Clear outputs before committing** - Keep notebooks clean in version control
- **Graduate code to src/** - Move finalized code from notebooks to Python modules
